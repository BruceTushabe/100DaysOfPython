The provided code has a few issues:

1. The method signature should specify the return type as boolean, but the current code returns false always. It needs to be modified to return true if the target is found.

2. The while loop condition `floorIndex + 1 < ceilingIndex` is incorrect. It should be `floorIndex < ceilingIndex - 1` to ensure the correct range of indices.

3. The code does not handle the case when the target is not found. It needs to include a condition to check if the target is not present in the given array.

Here is the modified code with bug fixes:

```java
public static boolean binary_search(int target, int[] nums) {
    int floorIndex = -1;
    int ceilingIndex = nums.length;

    while (floorIndex < ceilingIndex - 1) {
        int distance = ceilingIndex - floorIndex;
        int halfDistance = distance / 2;
        int guessIndex = floorIndex + halfDistance;
        int guessValue = nums[guessIndex];

        if (guessValue == target) {
            return true; // Return true if target is found
        } else if (guessValue > target) {
            ceilingIndex = guessIndex;
        } else {
            floorIndex = guessIndex;
        }
    }

    return false; // Return false if target is not found
}
```

With these changes, the code should work correctly and return true if the target is present in the given array, and false otherwise.
